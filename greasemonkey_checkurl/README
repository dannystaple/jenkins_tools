If you use Jenkins or Hudson for a project of reasonable size, you may find that it becomes slower on days you have been configuring a lot.
This is often due to some ajax magic on Jenkins that checks to see if the paths/globs you type into the archive artifacts box are valid - it can spend a long time searching these.

Required:
* Firefox
* The Greasemonkey plugin

Install
* Open the JS file, and if Greasemonkey is installed, firefox should recognise the script as such. 

When this is active, you will not notice a visual difference, but your Jenkins instance should no longer be receiving the AJAX checkurl calls for the archive artifacts list.
